## Uber Travel Time difference

Holding an idea that traveling time is an indicator of peopleâ€™s activities, I would like to know whether the travel time changes during the COVID-period. The data are referenced from <a href=" https://movement.uber.com/?lang=en-US">Uber Movements</a>. 
<br>
Because the most recent Uber Movements data are in March 2020, I choose to make the comparison between March 2020 and March 2019. Moreover, I would like to see the differences of mean daily travel time, mean am rush travel time and mean pm rush travel time.
