## Background

A new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), which generates symptoms such as fever, cough, trouble breathing, diarrhea and etc. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html">(CDC, 2020)</a> brought lots of changes to peopleâ€™s daily lives. In order to alleviate the spread of COVID, the World Health Organization suggests people to wear masks and keep social distance <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public">(WHO, 2020)</a>. At March 11, 2020, the first death case of Coronavirus was reported in Los Angeles <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/a-coronavirus-timeline/2334100/">(Kandel, 2020)</a>. Few days later, LA County ordered the closure of bars and gyms. Meanwhile, LAUSD (Los Angeles Unified School District) announced the closure of schools <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/a-coronavirus-timeline/2334100/">(Kandel, 2020)</a>. More and more amenities were closed during the following days.

As background information, the accumulated COVID cases is visualized by using `Folium`. The data are referenced from <a href="http://dashboard.publichealth.lacounty.gov/covid19_surveillance_dashboard/">County of Los Angeles, Public Health</a>. In addition, the Los Angeles community data are referenced from <a href="https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/countywide-statistical-areas-csa/data">County of Los Angeles, Countywide Statistical Areas (CSA)</a>.

### Method

```python
#set up
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import geopandas as gpd
np.random.seed(42)
%matplotlib inline

pd.options.display.max_columns = 999

import folium
```
```python
#load covid data
covid = pd.read_csv("path")

#load LA Community data
LAcommunity = gpd.read_file("https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/7b8a64cab4a44c0f86f12c909c5d7f1a_23.geojson")
```

```python
#merge the LA community geometries with Covid data
LA_joined = pd.merge(LAcommunity, covid, left_on="LABEL", right_on="geo_merge")

##normalize
# Minimum
min_val = LA_joined["cases_final"].min()

# Maximum
max_val = LA_joined["cases_final"].max()

# Calculate a normalized column
normalized = (LA_joined["cases_final"] - min_val) / (max_val - min_val)

# Add to the dataframe
LA_joined["normalized_covid"] = normalized

##convert data to geojson
#select used columns
LA_joined_sel = LA_joined[["LABEL", "cases_final", "normalized_covid", "geometry"]]
#change column names
LA_joined_sel.columns = ["Community Name", "Covid Cases", "normalized_covid", "geometry"]
#change to json file
covid_json = LA_joined_sel.to_json()
```
```

    input "feature".

# STEP 1: Initialize the map
