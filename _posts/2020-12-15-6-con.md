## Next step?

Results of 311 requests, traffic collisions demonstrate the number of events decreases during the COVID period. However, there are no clear evidences that the traveling time generally had decreased. Similarly, the air pollutants which are related to vehicle emissions do not show obvious trends.

The Uber data do not show trends because the data are aggregated in one month, in turn not clearly reflecting changes at the later month. However, the irregular trends about emissions are hard to find reasons behind them. Maybe the concentrations of pollutants are always around a low level in Los Angeles, so they are not persuasive indicators of whether the trips decrease or not. Or March is only the early stage of pandemic, lots of people do not have a sense about it.
